# framework7-scss
## Rewrite Framework7 Less files into SCSS

#### Notes
By default, Framework7 uses Less as preprocessor to it's styles. The only configure option it provides for developers is a color config named as `framework7.material.less`.

Less is not my favorite choice of preprocessors and also using this library in my projects, I have faced a lot issues in colors, themes, margins, padding, ..., so there was a drastically huge need to convert these styles into a maintainable and configurable structure.
    
Right now there is no global configure file in the project but it will be soon!

####The project only contains the material styles, There is a plan for the iOS as well.

This project's aim is to help developers of this framework if their choice has not been `Less` or want more options in their projects.

This library has been created to be used in developments and open source projects.
